## Quick start path

1. [Quick start](/docs/getting-started/quickstart) - run your first task with verification checks.
2. [Architecture](/docs/concepts/architecture) - understand orchestration boundaries and trust model.
3. [Core Flow](/docs/concepts/core-flow) - trace lifecycle from command to callback.
4. [Endpoints](/docs/api/endpoints) - review contracts used by webhook, task, callback, and config layers.

## Documentation map

| Lane | Focus | First page |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Quick Start | Production-ready first run and troubleshooting | [Quick start](/docs/getting-started/quickstart) |
| Concepts | Runtime model, worker behavior, and execution design | [Architecture](/docs/concepts/architecture) |
| Configuration | Credentials, defaults, and operational safety | [User config and secrets](/docs/configuration/user-config-gist) |
| API | Endpoint contracts, events, callback semantics, models | [Endpoints](/docs/api/endpoints) |

## Typical implementation sequence

- Start with app install and per-user config setup.
- Validate one issue-to-PR task end-to-end.
- Add operational guardrails (limits, retries, cancellation behavior).
- Integrate task state and callback contracts into your internal tooling.
